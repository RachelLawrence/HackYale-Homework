							Rachel Lawrence is a sophomore in Davenport College at Yale University, pursuing a double major in Applied Mathematics and Biology. When she is not playing the clarinet in DPops and the Yale Precision Marching Band, she can be found making digital paintings, working on math research, taming dragons, and trying to learn web design. In her free time, Rachel enjoys hiking, biking, and exploring rooftops.

							She may not be the hero New Haven needs right now, but she is the one it deserves.
